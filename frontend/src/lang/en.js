  aboutText2:
    "The beginning was challenging, and we had to learn a lot of new concepts. After approximately 8 weeks, we finally found a path to dive into the newly acquired knowledge. The second part began.",
  aboutText3:
    "In my opinion, it's beneficial for everybody if each person is involved in all aspects of the project. It might take more time, but being in this school, the advantage of learning SQL, backend, frontend, and styling is clearly visible.",
  aboutText4:
    "I want to express my gratitude to the entire team for this rewarding journey, and I wish everyone a pleasant time after completing the school.",
